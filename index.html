    <h1>What we do</h1>
    <p> Airbus always has been at the forefront of innovating new technologies, with a pioneering spirit that has redefined the aerospace industry. Our products bring people closer together, helping them unite and progress. We strive to continually push the boundaries on what is possible to safeguard our world for future generations.</p>

        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Connect</h3>
            <h5>Connecting for a better world</h5>
            <p> At Airbus, we believe connections are vital to making the world a better place. <br>That’s why we unite people and organisations across the globe; physically, with our commercial aircraft and helicopters; and virtually with our connectivity solutions, allowing them to connect, understand each other - and ultimately change the world for the better.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Serve Communities</h3>
            <h5>Supporting frontline workers</h5>
            <p> At Airbus, we are proud of how our products and services contribute to communities around the world. <br>Our satellites and tracking systems help make oceans safer with solutions that monitor and protect naval routes and maritime assets. Airbus-built aircraft are instrumental in firefighting, public safety and maintaining energy systems. Our products are the workhorses that carry out construction and infrastructure projects in local communities. And technology solutions from Airbus protect many critical systems from cyberattacks, helping maintain their integrity when it’s needed most.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Save lives</h3>
            <h5>Providing urgent help</h5>
            <p>Through humanitarian aid, we support our partners in times of crisis, providing aircraft, satellite imagery and other services when relief teams are literally fighting against the clock.<br>Our aircraft help transport patients for urgent medical care, and they assist in search efforts to find those marooned at sea, stranded in the mountains, or isolated in remote regions.<br>When a crisis occurs, our Earth observation satellites are tasked to acquire images of the concerned area. This imagery is delivered to relevant authorities, together with archived data, to rapidly assess the extent of damage and support rescue planning by allowing actions to be prioritized, and identifying if roads, bridges and airport runways are still operational. <br> At Airbus, we know this matters most – driving us in how we work and what we do </p>

            <h3>Protect</h3>
            <h5>Safeguarding national sovereignty</h5>
            <p> Our defence products and services help countries protect their citizens, values and vital infrastructure. In an unstable world, this security is a prerequisite of peace, the rule of law, political stability, democracy, environmental sustainability, human rights, economic development and prosperity, and scientific progress.</p>
